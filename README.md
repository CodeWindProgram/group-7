- Task 3:Researched about the tables required to create a online test portal schema ,the relationships between these tables and the constarints
- Task 4:Started coding the database schema using postgresql in groom IDE. Created tables required in the schema,established foreign key relationship among different tables and added constaints to each and every individual column if required

- Created 7 tables
   - students
   - packages (a 'package' categorizes a set of 'quizzes' (or tests). eg: All the 'Python' related tests are stored with 'package_id' of Python package.)
   - quizzes
   - questions
   - question_options
   - student_answers
   - tests_given
- Built necessary relationships between the tables using Primary and Foreign keys to avoid redundant duplication of data leading to lesser consumption of space.
- Created the relations in a way which makes it easier to implement aggregation.
- Tested JOIN operations with different inputs for relations between all the tables.
